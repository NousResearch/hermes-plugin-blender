# Prerequisites and connection

Official source: https://www.blender.org/lab/mcp-server/

This wrapper targets upstream revision `2cea8d566dde07fbac28a61d698909d69724e853` (v1.0.3): https://projects.blender.org/lab/blender_mcp

## Components

Hermes launches a stdio MCP server using uv. That process connects to the official Blender add-on over a loopback TCP bridge at 127.0.0.1:9876. The add-on runs inside Blender; installing this Hermes package does not install the add-on.

Required: Blender >=5.1, uv and Git available to the Hermes backend, network access on first MCP startup to fetch the pinned server and its Python dependencies. Upstream uses an isolated uv tool environment; dependencies are resolved by uv and are not fully locked by this spike package.

## User setup

1. Install the official Blender Lab MCP add-on using the instructions on the official page. The documented drag-and-drop flow may require two drops: one to add the Lab repository, the next to install the extension. Alternatively use Blender's Install from Disk action with the official extension ZIP.
2. Enable the MCP extension and Blender's Online access preference after reviewing its security warning.
3. Start the bridge from the add-on preferences (or its auto-start option), bound only to localhost with port 9876. Leave the default if using this package unchanged.
4. Enable this Hermes plugin for the intended profile and refresh/restart as required by your Hermes release. Check a real `get_objects_summary` response before claiming Blender is connected.

Never install an unrelated PyPI project named blender-mcp: this package deliberately fetches Blender Lab's source by full Git SHA.

## Failures

- `uv` or Git missing: prerequisite missing; do not silently install executables.
- Tool listing works but scene query fails: MCP process is up, but the Blender bridge is unavailable.
- Blender missing or too old: install/update is a separate user-approved action.
- `*_for_cli` tool reports `Blender executable not found at 'blender'`: these tools start `blender --background` from `BLENDER_PATH`, else `PATH`, and Hermes does not pass on a `BLENDER_PATH` set in a shell or `.env`. Put a `blender` command on the backend's `PATH`, for example in the directory that holds `uv`. On macOS, use a wrapper script that runs `/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender "$@"`. On Windows, add the folder containing `blender.exe` to `PATH` and restart Hermes.
- Port already used: identify the owner; do not kill it or attach to an arbitrary process.
- Remote Hermes backend: localhost means the backend's machine, not the Desktop client's machine. Both Blender and MCP must run on the intended host.
